# FIFA World Cup 2022 SQL Project

## Aims and Objectives
This project is the product of my work in the programming with data module of my MSc in Data Science. We were tasked with requirements for a database to store data about teams, players and other entities from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. First I began with creating an Entity Relationship Diagram to represent the database that I was going to build. Using MySQL I then had to create a database, create the tables, and populate those tables and then create SQL queries to answer questions about the data, and implement this also using python.
